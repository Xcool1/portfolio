## About
I am a computer Science and Economics student with an entrepreneurial mindset and passion for data science, software engineering, and user experience. This website is to showcase some of the projects I have worked on in more detail.

## Projects
**Network Analysis of Journalist ”bubbles” on Social Media**
[Research Document](JNetworks DocPDF.pdf)

Worked with the MUSE research group at UIUC to examine how or if social demographics and existing social inequalities manifest within professional networks such as X (formerly known as Twitter). Performed extensive data collection in aggregate, analysis, and modeling to establish how journalist/information clusters form on the basis of organization, gender, location, and other key demographics. Please refer to the research document above to observe the clusters generated and learn more about the context of the project.

**AI Itinerary Planner Website**
[Project Link](https://github.com/CS222-UIUC/course-project-chatbot

Collaborated with a team to create a website which integrates the OpenAI API to assist in planning trips to a given location and forming an itinerary. Users can create a profile which is saved and interact with the AI in a chat, as well as see previously stored itineraries generated.
